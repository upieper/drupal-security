Foreword
========

This document describes best practices for setting up and maintaining a Drupal
site. It was initially written for the Government of Canada, but it is equally
applicable to other organizations.

Drupal is a popular, open source content management system (CMS). It has a
strong security model, but like any application, requires adherence to best
practices. Furthermore, Drupal is only one piece of the software that is
required to run your site, and one needs to consider the security of the entire
set of software.

This is not a comprehensive document, as IT security is a complex field. We have
tried to focus on fundamental principles that can improve security. For more
information on web server security, see the links at the end of this article.

We do not believe that there will ever be a 100% secure system. There are always
bugs in software and new exploits are being attempted all of the time.  We are
listing options to consider, but each organization will need to weigh which
combination they are going to use.
