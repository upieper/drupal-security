G) Database Layer
=================

.. highlight:: ini

With Drupal's database abstraction layer you can now run it on `MySQL`_,
`SQLite`_, or `PostgreSQL`_ out of the box. There are in fact a number of
popular MySQL forks like `MariaDB`_ and `Percona`_. Drupal can run with MSSQL
too, but there will be more support for MySQL flavours of SQL. Oracle support
for PHP is weak, so it is not recommended to use this database. We are not aware
of any security advantages of one over the other.

The database for Drupal can run on the same server, but for performance reasons
it can be beneficial to set it up on another server. You want to ensure that
your server environment is robust enough that it cannot be easily brought down
by a Denial of Service (DOS) attack. There are a few server side tools to help
with this, but mostly it's useful to have a buffer, even at your highest traffic
times, so that your site is always responsive.

At the point where your server environment spreads on to more than one system,
it begins to make sense to have a second network behind the web server, possibly
including a VPN. It is quite likely that if the database is moved to an external
server that there may soon be other servers including more than one front-end
server too.

There is a lot that can be done to `secure your database`_. Much of it comes
down to reviewing `access permissions for the Drupal user`_ (set in Drupal's
settings.php), the backup user (which has read only access to do regular
backups) and the database's root user (which obviously has access to everything)
and verifying that they all have complex passwords. These need to be unique
passwords and the root password should not be stored on the server, but rather
in your encrypted Keepass database.

If your server is running locally, you can disable access for MySQL to the
network and force it to only use the internal IP address. If your web server and
database are on different servers, you won't be able to do this, but you will be
able to restrict what address MySQL will listen on. If your web server and
database server share a LAN, bind MySQL only to the LAN IP address and not any
Internet-facing ones. For a machine running both the web server and MySQL, you
can add this to your my.conf file::

  bind-address=127.0.0.1

Be sure to `review your databases, users and permissions`_ to see that there are
not any sample users or old databases still enabled on the server and that you
are not giving greater access to a user than they need. You should also review
the file system to see that the database files are restricted.

If you need a graphical tool like `phpMyAdmin`_, disable it after use. Web
applications like this can also be tightened down by placing them on a different
port, firewall that port from other than 127.0.0.1, and always access it via ssh
port forwarding. Access to these tools can also be limited to IP addresses for
extra protection. Note that any software you use should be regularly updated to
ensure that it receives any security enhancements, particularly if stored on the
server. You can restrict access to phpMyAdmin via .htaccess or by configuring
Apache to request an HTTP username/password login. They can also be restricted
to only allow access from certain trusted IP addresses. This is an important
vulnerability as it could give acracker full access to your databases. It can be
beneficial to put phpMyAdmin in its own VirtualHost and even run it on a
non-standard port. Force HTTPS connections to phpMyAdmin - do not use regular
HTTP. Also consider the implications of allowing database access via the web
server: There is little benefit if you have restricted which interfaces MySQL
will listen on, as described above, but then allow control of the database from
an Internet-facing web page.
